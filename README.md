Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm for strings derivation in context-free CNF grammars

Parse a string of symbols and, if the input is accepted by the language defined by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, return the root node of the derivation tree.
An example is given with the language of well-formed parenthesis.
